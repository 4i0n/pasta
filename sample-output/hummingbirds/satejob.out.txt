SATe INFO: Note that temporary files from the run have not been deleted, they can be found in:
   '/Users/mholder/.sate/satejob/temp_W1lRY'

SATe INFO: 
If you cannot see this directory in the Finder application, you may want to use
the 'open' command executed from a Terminal.  You can do this by launching the
/Applications/Utilities/Terminal program and then typing

open '/Users/mholder/.sate/satejob/temp_W1lRY'

followed by a return at the prompt. If the argument to the open command is a
directory, then it should open a Finder window in the directory (even if that
directory is hidden by default).
