Version 1.5 (Backward compatibility implications):
    pasta local home is now under ~/.pasta instead of ~/.sate
    file path config file is called ~/.pasta/pasta_tool_paths.cfg instead of ~/.sate/sate_tool_paths.cfg
    If no job name is given, it will be set by default to pastajob instead of satejob
    PASTA output (and logs) will say "PASTA INFO" instead of "SATe INFO". More generally, the logs will say PASTA instead of SATe.
    To turn on the debugging, now you need to use PASTA_DEBUG and PASTA_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG instead of SATE_DEBUG and SATE_LOGGING_LEVEL
    PASTA code changed such that in most places it uses "pasta" instead of "sate"
    Note: the config file still has a section named [sate]. This was not renamed to maintain compatibility. 
Version 1.4.1:
    Bug fix: GUI was broken in 1.4.0
    Disable multi-locus checkbox. Multi-locus is not supported in PASTA. 
Version 1.4.0:
    Uses hmmer to build the initial alignment if one is not given
    Initial tree also uses a masked alignment
