Release 2.2.2
=============
    - [BUG FIX] Previous version had used the "Centroid" decomposition even when
                the user specified "Longest."
    - [BUG FIX] Multiple issues dealing the handling very small subsets of taxa.
                These arise frequently in the "longest" edge decomposition, but
                are rare when using centroid decomposition.
    - [BUG FIX] Input sequences with all gaps no longer create problems (this
                can reasonably occur in multi-locus runs).
    - [CHANGES] FastTree binary in Mac bundle is compiled for more
                architectures.
    - [CHANGES] Updated documentation.
    - [CHANGES] RAxML user-specified arguments implemented in CLI.
    - [CHANGES] Post-processing RAxML search now uses
                start_tree_search_from_current boolean to determine whether to
                use the tree resulting from the SATe algorithm as starting tree.
    - [CHANGES] Updated bundled data.
    
Release 2.2.1
=============

    - [BUG FIX] Minor fix to initial GUI display. Initial "Model" options now
                correspond to FastTree options.
    - [CHANGES] updated documentation in README and FAQ.

Release 2.2.0
=============

    - [BUG FIX] No longer uses 'N' for missing taxa in multi-locus mode, which
                caused problems with multi-locus amino acid analyses with
                missing taxa.
    - [CHANGES] Fasttree is now bundled with SATe.
    - [CHANGES] New option to automatically set defaults based on size of
                dataset.
    - [CHANGES] Several default settings changed.

Release 2.1.0
=============

    - [BUG FIX] No longer write out duplicate sequence entries in final alignment output.
    - [CHANGES] Do not clean up files and directories in temporary working directory not created by SATe.
    - [BUG FIX] Check for gamma score in output file before using value in log file.

Release 2.0.3
=============

    - Fix for not terminating correctly in SATE-II-fast mode.
    - Allow specification of memory to be allocated to JVM when running Opal [NOTE: default memory allocation is now 1024MB instead of 2048MB].
    - Default to SATE-II-fast mode instead of SATE-II-ML.
    - SATE-II-ML defaults to 10 iterations instead of 100.

Release 2.0.2b
==============

    - Fix for multilocus analysis with non-equal leaf-sets.
    - Fix for allowing SATe application bundle to be run from directories with
      non-alphanumeric characters in path.

Release 2.0.1b
==============

    - Support for multilocus analysis.
    - `pairalign` (MAFFT) is not run if sequences are > 10K characters. This
      configuration has not been benchmarked.
