PASTA
=====
This is an implementation of the PASTA (Practical Alignment using SATe and TrAnsitivity) algorithm. This version is currently for testing purposes only. 

Acknowledgment 
===
The current version of this code is heavily based on the SATe code (http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/software/sate/sate.html)
Future versions would start from a fresh implementation.
